# Engine
The engine will contain the neede abstractions to have a more simple interaction

## Object creation
The engine will have classes to create objects meaning:<br>
1. Creating VBOs, VAOs
2. Compiling shaders
3. Loading Textures

These will be abstracted in a way that the user of this "engine" will have a simple method to create
Objects with textures, and manipulate them.
